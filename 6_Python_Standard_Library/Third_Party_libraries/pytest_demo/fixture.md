In pytest, fixtures are a powerful feature that 
helps you set up and manage resources or
preconditions for your tests. Fixtures provide
a way to organize code that needs to be shared 
across multiple tests, allowing you to set up 
common test scenarios, create reusable setups, 
and clean up resources after tests are executed.

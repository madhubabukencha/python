## Design Patterns
Most of the programming problems have well-established solutions.
**Design Patterns** offers well-known solutions to reoccurring
problems. These solutions are widely accepted by the software
development community. Design Patterns allow us to reuse the
solution and encourage us to use the best practices.

**Characteristics of Design Patterns**
- Design patterns are language neural, we can use them with any
  object-oriented programming language.
- Design Patterns are Dynamic

**Types of Design Patterns**<br>
We have 3 types of design patterns
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creational Design Patterns
We use creational design patterns to build objects systematically.
Creational patterns offer flexibility. For example, different
subtypes of objects from the same class can be created at runtime.

### Structural Design Patterns
These patterns establish a relationship between software
components in a particular setting or configuration. The
goal of design patterns is to satisfy both functional and
non-functional requirements. Functional requirement refers
to what software does. Non-functional requirements refer to
how well it completes its job.

### Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns are the best practices of how you make your
objects interact with each other. The focus here is defining the
protocol between these objects when trying to work together to
accomplish a common goal.

### Components of a Well-Designed Design Pattern
 To ensure the successful implementation of design patterns, it's crucial to consider the essential components that contribute to their effectiveness.
- Participants
- Quality Attributes
- Forces
- Consequeces

1. Participants<br>
Participants in a design pattern are the classes or elements involved in
forming the pattern. Each participant plays a distinct role in achieving 
the design pattern's objectives.

2. Quality Attributes<br>
Quality attributes are fundamental aspects that influence the entire
software and architectural solution. These attributes encompass 
non-functional requirements such as usability, modifiability, reliability,
performance, and more. Addressing these quality attributes is vital for the
overall success of a design pattern.

3. Forces<br>
Forces within a design pattern are the factors or conditions that influence
the decisions made during the design process. Identifying and understanding
these forces help in creating a robust and adaptive design that can handle
a various scenarios.

4. Consequences<br>
Consequences are the outcomes or results of implementing a design pattern. 
It is essential to analyze and comprehend these consequences to ensure that
the chosen design pattern aligns with the project's overall goals and requirements.

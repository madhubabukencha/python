<h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<hr size="3" noshade>
<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the programming paradigm based on
"Objects", which contains "data" in the form of fields(often known as attributes
or Properties), and code, in the form of procedure (often known as Methods).
The main goal of the object oriented programming is DRY(Don't repeat yourself)</p>

<h3>Class</h3>
<hr size="3" noshade>
<p>In OOP a "class" is a blueprint for an object. Each object was built from the
same set of blueprint(class) and therefor contains the same components (properties
and methods). From one class we can multiple number of instances(object).</p>

Eg : <b>class</b> Car:<br>
        &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; pass     


<h3>Object</h3>

<p>An object(instance) is an instantiation of class. When a class is defined, only
description for the object is defined. Therefore no memory or storage is allocated.</p>
Eg : honda = Car()<br>
honda is object of class Car.

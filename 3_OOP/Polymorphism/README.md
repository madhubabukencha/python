The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we
can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in
more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at
the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the
same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person
posses different behavior in different situations. This is called
polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important
features of Object Oriented Programming.

We can achieve this polymorphism through <strong>"method overloading", "operator overloading"
and "method overriding"</strong>

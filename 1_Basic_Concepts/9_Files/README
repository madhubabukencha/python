File is place where we can store or keep our data with some name
Files are usually stored in non-volatile memory(Ex:- hard drive,ect..,)
Since volatile memory(RAM) looses it data once computer is off.

To work with files in python we have to perform following actions
1) Open a file
2) read or write or append
3) Close

***************
* Open a file *
***************
Syntax: -
file_object = open(file_name[, access_mode][, buffering] )

file_name   : File name argument is string value that contains
              name of the file that you want to access
access_mode : The access mode defines the mode in the file has
              to be open and the default file access mode is read
buffering   : If the buffering value to set 0 then no buffering takes
              place. If it is 1 or greater than 1 line then buffering performed
              while accessing a file as per the indicated buffer size.
              If buffer size is negative the it will shows the system
              default behavior
EX-
f = open("sample.txt") # To open a file which is in current directory

# To open a file other than current location
f = open("C:/file/complete/path/sample.txt")

Python default function open() is used to open a file and returns
file object it's called handle

Here is a list modes in which we can open a python file
Mode                                       Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
r               It will Opens a file for "reading only" and the file pointer is
                placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.

rb              It will Opens a file for reading only in "binary" format. The
                file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is
                the default mode.

r+              It will Opens a file for both "reading" and "writing". The file
                pointer placed at the beginning of the file.

rb+             Opens a file for both "reading and writing in binary" format. The file
                pointer placed at the beginning of the file.

w               It will opens a file for "writing" only. Overwrites the file if the file
                exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing and
                it common for all write mode combinations

wb              It will Opens a file for "writing only in binary" format.

w+              Opens a file for both "writing and reading".

wb+             Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format.

a               Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file
                if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file
                does not exist, it creates a new file for writing and this functionality
                common for all append mode combinations

ab              Opens a file for appending in binary format.

a+              Opens a file for both "appending and reading".

ab+             Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format.

x           	Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists,
                the operation fails.

t	            Open in text mode. (default)

b	            Open in binary mode.

The operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages.
parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.
"""
# The "+" operator returns the sum of two operands
print("2+5=%d" % (2+5))
# The "-" operator returns the subtraction of two operands
print("2-5=%d" % (2-5))
# It will print the multiplication
print("2*5=%d" % (2*5))
# The "/" operator returns the quotient
print("5/2=%f" % (5/2))
# The "//" also returns the quotient but without fraction
print("5//2=", 5//2)
# It will return remainder of two operands
print("5%2=", (5 % 2))
# It will prints both quotient and remainder
print(divmod(5, 3))

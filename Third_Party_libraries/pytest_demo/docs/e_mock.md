### Mocking

In the context of software testing, mocking is a technique
used to replace parts of a system with simulated objects, 
known as mocks, in order to isolate and test specific components
of the code. Mocking allows you to control the behavior of certain
dependencies or external systems during testing, making it easier to
test the functionality of a specific unit without relying on the actual
implementation of its dependencies.
